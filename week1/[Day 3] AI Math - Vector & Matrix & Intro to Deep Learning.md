# [Day 3] AI Math - Vector & Matrix & Intro to Deep Learning

## 1. Vector

- Vector
  - In mathematics, physics, and engineering, a Euclidean vector or simply a vector is a geometric object that has magnitude (or length) and direction. [1]
- Operation
  - Suppose we have $$ x = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_d \end{pmatrix} \textmd{ and } y = \begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_d \end{pmatrix} $$
  - Addition & Subtraction
    $$ x \pm y = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \pm y_1 \\ x_2 \pm y_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_d \pm y_d \end{pmatrix} $$
